.SH NAME
cloudprint \- share CUPS printers with Google Cloud Print

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBcloudprint\fP script makes locally defined CUPS printers available to
a Google account, enabling local or remote printing from such services as
the Chrome browser, Chrome OS devices, or Android devices.

This is a lower-level command. Cloud Print services would normally be managed
through the cloudprint service.
